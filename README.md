# What is this?

This project is based upon the efforts of AndunHH. It takes their project and turns it into a library. This allows others who want to have a spacemouse in their project to do so very easily. Without being bound to the specific project structure, and microcontroller of AndunHH's code. It combines all of the functionality in terms of space mouse emulation and logic into a single easy to use class. It also uses Adafruits tiny USB library as its USB stack, which is what makes it possible to use this on a wide array of microcontrollers. This also simplifies the emulation, as just uploading the code means that the microcontroller is already going to show up as a spacemouse as well.
